##Concept:

An arena game where two or more tanks must fight for the victory.

The game will have a menu with 3 buttons: Singleplayer, Multiplayer and Options.

There will be the pause screen, the victory screen and the loose one.

The player can check on the HUD his own amount of hp and bullets remaining, with a minimap and the time.



##Rules:

1) It's possible to move all over the plan but:

      - you can't jump;

      - you can't exit the map;

2) There are a limited quantity of bullets assigned to every player but in 1:30 minutes from the start of the game some Bullets Bag will spawn into the Bullet Spawn Area* .



3)There can be only two human players but up to 10 total players (maxium of 8 AI)*.



4)The last tank with a number of hp > 0 wins.



5)If the time limit is set and you get out of time, it's game over.



##Requirement:

- One or more* tank 3d meshes.

- One or more Bullets Bag mashes.

- One or more Tank mimetic texture.

- Tank moving, tank shooting & tank getting hit SFXs.

- Bullets Bag grab SFX.

- Menu buttons's SFX.

- Background music.

**...Bullets Spawn Area* **: it's a rectangle area a little smaller then the map. It's useful to prevent the bullets spawning at the edge of the map.

**...8 AI* **: Notice that the AI's will only focus the player(s).

**One or more...* **: Would be great to implement more than one type of tank in the game.
